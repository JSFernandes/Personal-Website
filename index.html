            I was born in 1991 and my parents got me a second hand computer in 1996, which I managed to ruin a couple of years later after messing with the BIOS
            when I got bored of the games it had. In 2001 I got a brand new machine along with the authorization to use glorious 56Kb/s internet
            for a whole hour every week. This opened the door to a fascinating, yet terrifying world and I did a bit of everything, from chatting on IRC to
            reading webcomics, from typing like a normal person to "wt r u doin" and back to typing normally.</p>
            <p>In 2005 I upgraded my machine and got a better connection, which led to more online time. However, I was still tending towards
              medicine as a career choice, as I had a very traditional education and had very little idea that it could be so interesting to work
              in programming and software development. During high school my grades weren't up to par for medicine and after hearing stories from software
              developers and giving it some thought I decided to study software engineering. I'm pretty thankful I didn't study enough now.</p>
            <p>In 2009 I began studying at FEUP without any programming knowledge, but I managed to catch up pretty quickly and I now have my course up to date with
              a satisfying average. During this time I developed not only coding skills, but also a fondness for challenge and pressure, along with proactivity, 
              ambition and some dislikeness for excessive rest. I have attended <a href="http://codebits.eu">SAPO Codebits</a> in both 2011 and 2012, and I'm looking
              towards attending the next edition as well. I have also worked as a teaching assistant at FEUP, helped organize <a href="http://eneiporto.pt">ENEI 2013</a> and
              had the honour of having one of my projects selected for a FEUP exposition for high school students.</p>
            <p>I will now spend the next semester (September 2013-February 2014) studying at Sapienza Università di Roma and I am looking for a thesis subject
              to get me working hard and smart as soon as I return.</p>
