        <p>
          I'm originally from Porto, Portugal, and currently live in Barcelona, working for
          <a href="https://https://novicap.com/">Novicap</a> as a Software Engineer. Before working at Novicap,
          I did some volunteer work for <a href="https://movingworlds.org/">MovingWorlds</a>,
          where I did some improvements to their website on a volunteer basis while based in Colombia.
          Before that, I was a developer at <a href="https://www.seedrs.com/" target="_blank">Seedrs</a>,
          which I joined after graduating from univeristy.
        </p>

        <p class="show-large-only">
          Before graduating, I enjoyed the amazing of opportunities of working as a
          Teaching Assistant in my University, and studying for 5 months in the beautiful city of
          Rome under the Erasmus programme.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my daily work I use Ruby on Rails, with SASS, Javascript, JQuery, Ember.js, RSpec,
          Cucumber and Git in a UNIX environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I act as a facilitator of agile processes, and work to improve my team's autonomy,
          through analytics and interaction with stakeholders.
        </p>

        <p class="show-large-only">
          I'm an avid traveler, having been to many European cities, Tokyo, and San Francisco.
          I am thrilled by the idea of exploring more of Asia, and Latin America.
        </p>
